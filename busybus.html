              <p><b>1.</b> Most people do not use the bus as their primary mode of transportation (81.3%),
            while 18.8% reported that they do. </p>
							<p><b>2.</b> Focusing primarily on bus riders, 50% use it daily while 50% use it a few times a week, mostly for getting to work.</p>

							<p>Most riders walk no more than 5 minutes from their homes to their stops (83.3%), but time spent waiting for the bus varies; 16.7% spend 0-5 minutes, 66.7% spend 6-15 minutes, and 16.7% spend 16-30 minutes waiting.

                          <p><b>1.</b> Bus riders will benefit from having real-time updates so they know when to expect buses, and would like to track them in real-time (similar to how Lyft and Uber rides).</p>
                          <p><b>2.</b> Users also wish to know when to begin heading to their stops, and be notified of any changes in the expected time of their bus. This will reduce wait times, diminishing a major pain point.</p>
                          <p><b>3.</b> In the event of a signal failure, users would also like offline access to schedules and routes so they have some idea of when to begin moving. For added convenience, and because not all apps have this feature, an in-app payment option will attract more users in future.</p>

                              in establishing a minimum viable product,including being able to see real-time updates, notifications or approaching buses, and adding items to a 'Favorites' list. From this list,
                              I created a user flow that integrated as much as possible to test out general functionality.

                            <p>When creating the visual prototype, I put a map on every screen based on user feedback. Some aspects of my sketches did not translate as well to the visual design as
                              I anticipated, and thus the design underwent a second iteration.
                            </p> <br>
                            <p> <b> Some points of feedback from other designers were as follows:</b>
                              <p><b>1.</b> Add current location address so that user knows distance to destination </p>
                              <p><b>2.</b> Add more weight to some of the text; it is difficult to read at 100% zoom</p>
                              <p><b>3.</b> Highlight city at the top of the screen</p>
                              <p><b>4.</b> Add 3 screens of hi - fi design hen show prototype</p>

                            <b style="font-size:24px;">Up to Code</b>
                            <p>I wanted to see how well my design would translate into code. Using Atom, I coded the HTML and CSS for BusyBus' homepage. When looking back to my design in Figma.
                              I felt it was unnecessary to add labels on the screen; they are self-explanatory. The route data was also restructured to display based on direction,
                              with reroutes and out of service lines at the bottom of the list. I added a cap on the page width to see how everything would expand from mobile to larger displays.

                              <!--  <h4 class="section-sub-header">If I had more time,</h4> -->
                                <p>If I were to do this project again I would like to add more functionality including online payment and real time updates about trains and ferries. Also I would like to conduct more research for trains and ferries
                                  passengers to get a clearer idea of how many people use trains and ferries and their travel needs.
                                </p>

                              <!--  <h4 class="section-sub-header">Appreciate and comprehend the work of
                                    others</h4> -->
                                <p>I think it would be important to build in a toggle between dark and light mode, giving riders more control of their viewing experience as well as  continue experimenting with
                                  typography to see if there are better hierarchies I can apply. <p>

                                    <p>Ultimately, BusyBus gives users accurate and real-time updates for local routes, assuaging any concerns they have about missing their bus.<p>
